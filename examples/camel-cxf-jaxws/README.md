Camel CXF JAX-WS Example
------------------------

This example demonstrates using the camel-cxf component with JBoss Fuse on EAP to produce and consume JAX-WS web services.

In this example, a Camel route takes a message payload from a direct endpoint and passes it on to a CXF producer endpoint. The producer uses the payload
to pass arguments to a CXF JAX-WS web service.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Maven
* An application server with JBoss Fuse installed

Running the example
-------------------

To run the example.

1. Start the application server in standalone mode `${JBOSS_HOME}/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full-camel.xml`
2. Build and deploy the project `mvn install -Pdeploy`
3. Browse to http://localhost:8080/example-camel-cxfws/

You should see a page titled 'Send A Greeting'. This UI enables us to interact with the test 'greeting' web service which will have also been
started. The service WSDL is available at http://localhost:8080/example-camel-cxfws/greeting?wsdl.

There is a single service operation named 'greet' which takes 2 String parameters named 'message' and 'name'. Invoking the web service will return
a response where these values have been concatenated together.

Testing Camel CXF JAX-WS
------------------------

Web UI
------

Browse to http://localhost:8080/example-camel-cxfws/.

From the 'Send A Greeting' web form, enter a 'message' and 'name' into the text fields and press the 'send' button. You'll then
see the information you entered combined to display a greeting on the UI.

So what just happened there?

`CamelCxfWsServlet` handles the POST request from the web UI. It retrieves the message and name form parameter values and constructs an
object array. This object array will be the message payload that is sent to the `direct:start` endpoint. A `ProducerTemplate`
sends the message payload to Camel. `The direct:start` endpoint passes the object array to a `cxf:bean` web service producer.
The web service response is used by `CamelCxfWsServlet` to display the greeting on the web UI.

The full Camel route can be seen in `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/cxfws-camel-context.xml`.
